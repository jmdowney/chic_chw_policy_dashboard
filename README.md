# CHIC proCHW Policy Dashboard
## The largest-ever public dashboard for community health worker policies
This repository houses the code for the CHIC proCHW Policy Dashboard, which can be found at http://joinchic.org/wins/#dashboard. Community Health Impact Coalition is making professional community health workers (proCHWs) the norm worldwide by changing guidelines, funding, and policy. Our goal is to see 40+ low- and middle-income countries adopt proCHW policies. To track progress and accelerate policy change, weâ€™re excited to steward the largest-ever public-facing dashboard on proCHW policies. The dashboard is intended to be a shared resource for the entire field. Help us keep it current by submitting tips or updates.

## Methods
We developed this dashboard in two phases: (a) policy analysis, and (b) design and visualization. Policy analysis involved identifying the latest community health policy (or equivalent document) for the countries in scope via desk review and stakeholder outreach; data extraction into a Google Sheet template; and initial validation of findings by CHIC collaborators. The dashboard design and visualization involved light data cleaning using R to generate a live Google sheet of final data, [published to the web and viewable by anyone](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTB8mJ566h_z1RJEn3D2StMElgN0MMfripYmhaeSQ3Y/edit?usp=sharing). This repository houses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that is used to fetch the data from this spreadsheet, link it by country ISO A3 code with a Mapbox style, and add interactive elements to produce a final dashboard.  

## Update Process
We are committed to providing the latest and greatest information in this policy dashboard. [We accept update requests for the data on a rolling/ongoing basis here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQfSZ9YG6ecSnWiBoUshtKBRGXVyYPt4Hfo_nx4ugBFkaEww/viewform) Once received, our team will review your submission, validate the information, and publish updates to the dashboard on a quarterly basis. We encourage submissions to fill in missing data or to request an update for existing country data. You can check the date a country was last updated by clicking on the country on the map.

We also encourage pull requests! If you have ideas for extensions to the dashboard, or improvements to the code, please open a PR.
